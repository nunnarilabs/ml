Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical
   decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX
   (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision
   making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates
   cars according to the following concept structure:

   CAR                      car acceptability
   PRICE                  overall price
   buying               buying price
   maint                price of the maintenance
   TECH                   technical characteristics
   COMFORT              comfort
   doors              number of doors
   persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry
   lug_boot           the size of luggage boot
   safety               estimated safety of the car
