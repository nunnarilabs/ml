# Adult Income Census
This dataset originates from the 1994 Census Bureau database and was curated by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker as part of their work in Data Mining and Visualization at Silicon Graphics. 
They extracted a set of data records that met specific criteria, which were as follows: 
- individuals were selected if they were older than 16 years of age,
- had an annual income (AGI) exceeding $100, had a final weight (AFNLWGT) greater than 1, and
- worked for at least some hours per week (HRSWK > 0).
  
The objective of this dataset is to predict whether a person's annual income exceeds $50,000.
